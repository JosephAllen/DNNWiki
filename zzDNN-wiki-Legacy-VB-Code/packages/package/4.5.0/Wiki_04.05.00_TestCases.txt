Enhancements

The "index" is no longer on the left in the menu, it is now "show all pages" and takes you to another page that lists off all pages.

the left menu is no longer being built in a table, it should allow you to customize things better with CSS now, though I believe it will still display like it used to until you customize the CSS (that was the goal)

Lots of code refactoring, moving things around, trying to streamline the code to make it easier to add enhancements.

Moved the Edit/Add/ViewHistory links out into a separate control that allows for display in other situations.
